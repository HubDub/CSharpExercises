Constructors

Modify the above Car class so that it has an instance variable called name of type string Add a constructor that accepts a string parameter and sets the car's name using this parameter. Add a GetName() method that returns the car's name. 

Finally, modify the main application so that it sets the car's name via the constructor, then prints the cars name (retrieving it using GetName()). 

Your program should output this: 


Car started!
My Car




.... where "My Car" is whatever name you give to the car.
