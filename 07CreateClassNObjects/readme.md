Create Classes and Objects

First, create a main program as in the first exercise. 

Next, define a new class in its own file. Call the class Car. Give it a single method called "Start". Make the method simply print "Car started!". 

In your main program, create a new Car object and call its Start() method. 

Your final program should simply therefore display the text "Car started!".
