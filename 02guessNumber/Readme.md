An Interactive Program

Create a program that asks the user to enter an integer. If the integer is less than 10, print the message "This number is too small". If the integer is greater than or equal to 10, print "This number is big enough". 

Hint: read a line and then use Int32.TryParse() to convert the text to an integer. There is also a Int.Parse method, but it crashes if it can't parse your text to an integer. Well OK, it throws an exception. So don't use it. 

As always, if you get stuck, check the answer, hide it again and try to write it from memory.
