Looping Through 2D Arrays

Create an application that uses two nested for loops to loop through the 2D array defined in previous exercise and print the values. 

Hint: Here's the outer loop: 

for(int row = 0; row < 2; row++) 
{
}




The inner loop should use a loop variable called "col" (or whatever you like) and should loop through the columns. 

Hard code the number of columns and rows. 

Once again, this is one of the trickiest beginner's tasks in C#. If you can't work it out by now you know what to do. Check the answer .... 

Remember to follow rigorous indentation. The code in your outer loop should all be indented one tab. The code in your inner loop should be indented another tab. 

Good indentation hygiene is one of the keys to a healthy C# program. 

Try to make the output look like a 2x3 table, like the following: 


one     two     three
apple   orange  banana




Hint: tabs are a good way to make your strings line up.
