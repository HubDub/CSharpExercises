Two Dimensional Arrays

A bit trickier, this one. Write an application that creates a two-dimensional array of strings, with two rows and three columns. Print the value in the second row and third column. 

Hint: regular 2D arrays can be declared using [,] instead of []. You can then access the array using [x,y], where x and y are the indices of the elements you want. 

When you initialize the array (put actual numbers into it), remember that each element is an array in itself. 

If attempting this question causes you such mental anguish that you travel to Sri Lanka to become a Buddhist monk or nun, only to get caught up in the monk-on-monk interfactional fighting, once you return home you might want to check the answer, hide it again and see if you can write the program from memory. 

Remember, a 2D array is basically just a table of values, unlike a 1D array which is a list of values. When accessing the array, refer to the row and then the column. 

So there's no need tear your hair out. Just go easy on yourself.
